USER INFO:
Provided are two programs, minls and minget. 

minls is used to peruse a minix file system and look at its contents.

minget is used once you have a file destination in mind and would like to
copy it over to your desktop environment.

This was created in a virtual Ubuntu x86 environment, and is not intended
to run outside of a unix-based system.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The provided makefile creates minls and minget executables.

Minix file system images are provided in 'Example Images'. 

Both minls and minget provide proper usage information upon incorrect
provided arguments, or by providing the '?' argument.

ISSUES:
When reading the root directory of TestImage, I get tons of "deleteme"
file entries, all with an inode of 0. So I ignore them, but this puts my
programs in a (seemingly) infinite loop. Not sure where the other files in
that directory are, but they are pretty well hidden.

OTHER THOUGHTS:
This project started out rocky but I kinda got there in the end. My first
major hurdle was trying to figure out the partition table. I soon learned that
the signature isn't at at 510 offset from the beginning of the partition
table, but instead a 510 offset from the beginning of the file/partition.

After that I spent a lot of time (see also: too much) on figuring out how to
deal with indirect/double indirect blocks. I had wanted to just read
every zone number into a list and return that, but it was really hard to
wrap my head around. I decided to just translate the linear zone numbers
into actual zone numbers, like you originally suggested.

I'm not incredibly happy with how the programs turned out, if I had more time
(and less final projects to work on) I would've fleshed out a couple things
and done more extensive tests. But now I can show people what indirect
zones are and tell them that I solved them, so I have that going for me
